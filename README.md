# ACT - Simple Reaction Test

<h1> Important Note </h1>
The issues accompanying this repository are supposed to be available to students in Prof. Velasco's CPSC 362-07 class. If you are not in this class then I will unfortunately not be pulling your code into the repository. However, after May 20, 2022 I will allow anyone to contribute.

<h2> About </h2>
<p> This website houses a collection of games which test the user's reaction speed. As of now there are 3 games, 2 of which are working. The first game is a traditional reaction speed test- click the box when it changes color. Your time is recorded in a list. The other working game is similar, except a small circle will randomly appear in the box. Your time is only recorded if you click within the bounds of the circle.
</p>

The unfinished game is a modification of the first game -- the user quickly takes 5 games in a row and their score is the average of their 5 scores.

The remaining issues have to do with adjustments to the website layout and other small features.

<h1> In order to contribute </h1>
<ul>
  <li><h2> Set Up Your Environment </h2>
    <p> I have used VS 2019 for all of my code work. I will not require you to do the same-- use whichever IDE you want. Furthermore, forking the repository and initiating a pull request for your issue (given you have fixed the issue) would be a great place to start .</p>
    <p> There is no need to run this website through a server. At the moment, there are no modules which require a live connection so running the index.html in any browser should be all you need. </p>
  </li>
  
  <li><h2> Coding Standards </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> All "common sense" coding standards will apply. This means self-explanatory variable names and relatively readable code. </li>
      <li> Documenting functions and sections of code via comments is highly recommended. </li>
      <li> The issues I have listed should not need additional files to be created. If you worked in another file which you created, I would greatly appreciate if you merged your code into one of the available files. (In other words, the only files which need to be modified should be <code>index.html</code>, <code>main.css</code>, <code>styles.css</code>, <code>reactiontest.js</code>, and <code>graph.js</code>. </li>     
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><h2> Tests </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Front End: I will be testing your front end solution on a 1920 x 1080 window. Other browser window sizes will not be tested and will not have an affect on your pull request. If you are experiencing troubles with the website's styling/spacing, it may be because you changed your window size after loading the website. Hit refresh while your browser window is the adequate size and you should be able to continue your work. </li>
      <li> Back End: I will check my browser console if any errors occur. If no errors occur, then I will deem your code sufficient. However, if you are working on the game, I will test your game first, then the other two in succession. If your game has an affect on either of the other games' outcomes then unfortunately I will have to ask you to find the problem before I can pull the code in. </li>
      <li> Browser support: I will only be testing if your solution works on Google Chrome. Other browsers will not be tested. As long as your solution works on a Desktop computer running Chrome I will pull your code into the repository. Furthermore, mobile devices will not be tested. </li>     
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><h2> Issue Acquisition </h2>
    <p> Simply comment on the issue you want and I will assign you to it. First come first serve! Thanks! </p>
    <p> If you have decided that you no longer want to work on the issue, just let me know as soon as possible so I can free up the issue! </p>
  </li>
  
</ul>
