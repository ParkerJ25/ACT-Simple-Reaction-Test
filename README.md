# ACT - Simple Reaction Test

<h1> Important Note </h1>
The issues accompanying this repository are supposed to be available to students in Prof. Velasco's CPSC 362-07 class. If you are not in this class then I will unfortunately not be pulling your code into the repository. However, after May 20, 2022 I will allow anyone to contribute.

<h2> About </h2>
<p> This website houses a collection of games which test the user's reaction speed. As of now there are 3 games, 2 of which are working. The first game is a traditional reaction speed test- click the box when it changes color. Your time is recorded in a list. The other working game is similar, except a small circle will randomly appear in the box. Your time is only recorded if you click within the bounds of the circle.
</p>

The unfinished game is a modification of the first game -- the user quickly takes 5 games in a row and their score is the average of their 5 scores.

The remaining issues have to do with adjustments to the website layout and other small features.
